# Changelog

All notable changes to harness-os will be documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.5.5] — 2026-06-18

### Changed
- **Skills Refactoring (34→32)**: Removed 2 redundant skills, fixed tier/trigger inconsistencies, added routing guidance.
  - Deleted `spec-driven-workflow` — content fully covered by `harness-workflow` RIPER-5 phases.
  - Deleted `parallel-coordination` — merged DAG decomposition content into `subagent-driven-development`.
  - Promoted `csharp-baseline` to tier 1 (was tier 2) — now auto-suggested for dotnet projects like `php-baseline`.
  - Promoted `verification-loop` to tier 2 (was tier 3) — trigger changed from `task_update` to `verify_run`.
  - Removed `session_start` trigger from `autonomous-optimizer` (too specialized for every session).
  - Added routing guidance tables to `csharp-bugfix` ↔ `csharp-repair` and `verification-loop` ↔ `finishing-a-development-branch`.
  - Added `php-codeigniter-4-workflow` hook to `tdd-workflow`.
  - Updated `write-a-skill` schema to document `tier` and `keywords` fields.
- **Skill Combination Guide**: Added "How to Combine Skills" section to `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `templates/AGENTS.md.tpl` with formula and examples per task type.
- **Decoupled Language-Specific Skill Triggers**: Removed independent triggers (`session_start`, `task_create`) from C# and PHP workflows (`csharp-code-review`, `csharp-bugfix`, `csharp-feature`, `csharp-repair`, `php-codeigniter-3-workflow`, `php-codeigniter-4-workflow`) to prevent automatic loaded clutter.
- **Integrated Generic Workflow Hooks**: Injected hooks into core workflows (`code-review-workflow`, `systematic-diagnosis`, `tdd-workflow`, `verification-loop`) to conditionally recommend or load corresponding language-specific skill workflows.
- **Updated Agent Instructions**: Updated `AGENTS.md` and `templates/AGENTS.md.tpl` (specifically Step 9 and Step 12) to guide agents to load specific framework workflows and review checklists when working on those stacks.
- **Standardized Review Severity**: Standardized severity levels in C# code review skills into standard categories (Critical, Important, Minor).

## [1.5.4] — 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Sensitive Data Filtering (Redaction)**: Added regex-based redaction patterns (e.g. for API keys, passwords, database URLs, authorization tokens, private keys) in `src/lib/redact.ts` and integrated it into the `auditLog` tool handler in `src/lib/wrapper.ts` to ensure credentials and secrets are filtered out of logs.
- **Error Stack Tracing in Audits**: Modified the MCP tool wrapper in `src/lib/wrapper.ts` to capture and include the full error stack trace (`err.stack`) inside the JSON payload of `tool_error` audit logs, enabling much easier debugging of server failures.
- **Verify Run Caching**: Added repository state hashing (using git HEAD commit hash and git status changes) to bypass verify runs (`verify_run`) when the code has not changed since the last successful verify, saving it in `.harness/verify_cache.json`.
- **Scope Check Performance Caching**: Added `mtimeMs` checking for `scope.yaml` and a `Map`-based regex compile cache for `picomatch` in `src/tools/scope.ts` to speed up scope checks.

### Changed
- **Log Rotation Refactoring**: Refactored the audit JSONL logger in `src/db/audit.ts` to implement Standard Log Rotation: when `audit.jsonl` exceeds 10MB, it creates a timestamped backup copy and then truncates the active file to 0 bytes instead of appending indefinitely.

## [1.5.3] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- **GitLab Project ID Auto-Detection**: Integrated GitLab API client inside `harness init` / `createRepoConfig` to automatically retrieve the numeric project ID of a repository using GitLab credentials (`X-GitLab-Token` / `--token`) from global MCP configurations (`mcp_config.json`) and save it to `.harness/config.yaml`.
- **Force Overwrite for config.yaml**: Allowed `harness init --force` command flag to cleanly re-generate and overwrite `.harness/config.yaml` to refresh repo details or project IDs.
- **Human-readable Global Repo Folders**: Enhanced `generateRepoId` to prefix the UUID with the sanitized repository name (e.g., `my_project-a1b2c3d4`). This makes global state directories in `~/.harness/repos/` much easier to discover and manage.
- **Detailed Tool Audit Logging**: The MCP wrapper now logs the full `args` and `result` payloads (instead of just argument keys) to the SQLite audit database and JSONL file, providing rich datasets for analyzing agent behavior and debugging. This is controlled by `HARNESS_VERBOSE_AUDIT` (enabled by default).

### Changed
- **Unified Agent Instructions**: Consolidated duplicate rules sections in the `AGENTS.md.tpl` template and `AGENTS.md` by merging the custom development guidelines (Commit Gate, Vietnamese language accents, UTF-8 no BOM encoding) into the standard `Rules — Violation = Task Failed` and `Non-Negotiable Rules` blocks.
- **Preserve Repo Identity**: `harness init` now reads and preserves existing `.harness/config.yaml` files instead of indiscriminately overwriting them. This prevents the creation of orphaned global state folders when initializing an existing repository multiple times.
- **Removed Local Progress File**: `harness init` no longer creates a local `.harness/progress.md` file, fully embracing the v1.0 global state architecture.

### Improved
- **Robust Doctor Check**: Excluded optional/runtime state files (like `progress.md`, `handoff_last.json`, and `never_again.md`) under the `.harness/` directory from being evaluated as broken/missing references in `harness doctor` CLI check.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Skill Suggestions & Workflow Guidance**:
  - **Dynamic Suggested Skills**: `session_start` and `task_create` now return up to 3 context-relevant tier 2/3 suggested skills.
  - **Workflow Phase Navigation**: Introduced `workflow_guidance` response to guide agents across standard development phases (`START` → `SELECT` → `EXECUTE` → `VERIFY` → `WRAP_UP`).
  - **Verify warning validation**: `session_handoff` now prints a warning if `verify_run` was not executed during the session.
  - **Tier 3 on-demand matching**: Enabled strong keyword match filtering (score >= 2.0) for tier 3 on-demand skills in `skill-matcher.ts`.
- **Database Phase Tracking**:
  - Added SQLite migration to add `current_phase` (default 'START') and `verify_called` (default 0) columns to `sessions` table.

### Changed
- **Adapter & Template Updates**: Updated `AGENTS.md.tpl`, `AGENTS.md`, `codex/AGENTS.md`, and `copilot/copilot-instructions.md` to reflect the new dynamic suggestions, workflow phases, and tool counts (30 tools, down from 32).

### Improved
- **DX: Flexible `session_handoff` input** — `unfinished` and `next_steps` parameters now accept both a single string and an array of strings via `z.preprocess` auto-coercion, eliminating Zod validation errors when agents pass a string instead of an array.
- **DX: Consistent error returns** — `sessionEnd()` and `sessionHandoff()` no longer `throw` on session-not-found; they return `{ error: "..." }` objects, following the project convention of never throwing from tool handlers.

### Removed
- **Passive feature_list module**: Removed `feature_list_read` and `feature_list_update` MCP tools, their code in `state.ts`, templates, unit tests, and documentation.
- **Dead files**: Deleted obsolete `init.sh.tpl` and `feature_list.json.tpl` templates.

### Tests
- Added unit tests for workflow phase transitions and task creation skill suggestions in `src/tools/task.test.ts`.
- Updated test suites in `src/tools/session.test.ts`, `src/tools/verify.test.ts`, `src/lib/skill-matcher.test.ts`, and `src/lib/state-migration.test.ts`.
- Total: 210 unit tests passing (Vitest) + MCP smoke test validated for all 30 tools.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Workflow & Ceremony Optimizations**:
  - **Lockfile Caching**: Auto-compute and cache lockfile hashes (`.harness/lockfile_hash.txt`) during `verify_run` `install` step, bypassing installation if lockfile is unchanged.
  - **Quick Start Mode**: Added `quick` and `quick_task_title` options to `sessionStart`/`sessionResume` and the `harness quick-start` CLI command.
  - **Optional Verification Steps**: Supported marking verify steps as `optional: true` in `verify.yaml`, preventing optional step failures from blocking validation.
  - **CLI Flags**: Supported `--skip-install` and `--force-install` flags in `harness verify`.
- **Database & Logging Resilience**:
  - **Clean Connection Closing**: Automatically closes SQLite DB connection on process `exit` and termination signals (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`), preventing locks.
  - **Non-truncating Timestamped Audit Backups**: Compresses entire `audit.jsonl` log to `audit.<timestamp>.jsonl.gz` every time the file size grows by another 10MB, without truncating the original log file.

### Changed
- **API updates**: Registered quick start options and new verify flags in MCP schemas.

### Tests
- Added lockfile cache and optional steps tests to `src/tools/verify.test.ts`, and quick session start tests to `src/tools/session.test.ts`.
- Added unit tests for timestamp-based audit log compression in `src/db/audit.test.ts`.
- Total: 207 unit tests passing (Vitest) + MCP smoke test validated for all 32 tools.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Self-Learning & Knowledge Evolution Layer**:
  - **New tool: `reflection_run`**: Extract raw execution metrics, tool frequencies, and error patterns from session/task audit events.
  - **Fuzzy Instinct Search**: Extended `instinct_get` with fuzzy query matching using the skill-matcher tokenizer and type filters.
  - **Rich Knowledge Metadata**: Extended `instinct_add` to support `type` (instinct, lesson, pattern, anti_pattern, decision, experiment), `context`, `resolution`, and `review_trigger`.
  - **Never Again System**: Added `.harness/never_again.md` file-based system, injecting critical warnings and relevant past knowledge/lessons into `session_start` and `session_resume` response context.
  - **`harness knowledge` CLI Command**: Command-line tool to list, filter, and add lessons, decisions (ADRs), experiments, and patterns in the SQLite DB.
  - **Reflections Tracking**: Added `reflections` table in SQLite schema to keep lightweight task reflection summaries.

### Changed
- **CLI improvements & fixes**: Fixed duplicate `rawPath` declarations and options parsing in `harness init`.

### Tests
- Added `src/tools/reflection.test.ts` (1 test) and `src/tools/instinct.test.ts` (2 tests).
- Total: 202 tests passing (Vitest) + MCP smoke test validated for all 32 tools.

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Hook System (Chốt kiểm soát)** — Introduced pre-tool block hooks (to prevent dangerous tool calls based on arguments regex patterns) and stop validation hooks (to enforce passing specific verification steps before ending a session). Controlled via `.harness/hooks.yaml`.
- **Codebase Search MCP Tools** — Added `code_search_grep` and `code_search_symbols` to allow local file system search of text, regex patterns, and code structure definitions (classes, functions, methods, interfaces). Yields JSON results up to 8KB.
- **Ralph Loop CLI Orchestrator** — Added `harness orchestrate` command to automate sequential lifecycle pipelines, keeping sessions alive and retrying failed validations automatically up to a maximum loop threshold.

### Changed
- **Sync AGENTS.md** — Incremented registered tool count to 31 across 11 modules and documented codebase search tools and CLI orchestrator parameters. Added a strict instruction rule demanding prompt updates of documentation after code modifications.
- **Dynamic Versioning & Script** — Implemented dynamic reading of `package.json` version field inside the MCP server constructor, and added a automated version synchronizer script (`pnpm run sync-version`) to align version numbers across static documentation, tests, and configurations.
- **Smoke test** — Registered `code_search_grep` and `code_search_symbols` in the expected tool list of scripts/smoke-test.ts.
- **Skill Version Metadata Validation** — Updated `skillList` to read the skill version from `metadata.version` first (according to the agentskills.io specification), falling back to top-level `version`. This resolves the `missing version` warnings reported by `harness doctor`.
- **Explicit Zod Dependency** — Added `zod` as an explicit dependency in `package.json` to ensure clean TypeScript builds under nodeNext module resolution.

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **Real Subagent Worker Execution** (`subagent_invoke`) — Added a real Worker Process model that dispatches and executes command payloads sequentially under a standalone worker (`src/subagent-worker.ts`), truncating command outputs to 8KB per command and returning a structured run-result JSON.
- **Worker Process blocking and non-blocking modes** — Parent process can choose to wait/block for the worker (`wait: true`) or spawn a detached background worker (`wait: false` or default).
- **Auto-Generate Repo Summary during `harness init`** — The CLI initializer now automatically creates `repo-summary.md` and `repo-summary.meta.json` in the `.harness/` directory when creating a new harness environment, providing immediate repository maps to new agents.
- **New contextual skills** (Phase 5):
  - `brainstorming` — Structured brainstorming, generating multiple approaches with trade-off analysis.
  - `subagent-driven-development` — Decomposing and dispatching tasks using `subagent_invoke` effectively, with sample worker roles (Coder, Tester, Linter, Reviewer).
  - `code-review-workflow` — Consolidated `requesting-code-review` and `receiving-code-review` skills into a single workflow for self-review, structured requests, and processing feedback.
  - `finishing-a-development-branch` — Handoff checklist, CHANGELOG updates, and branch cleanup.
- **Unit test suite for subagent tools** (`src/tools/subagent.test.ts`) covering scope validation, worker execution, blocking mode, and output capture.

### Security
- **Skill Name Path Traversal Block** — `skill_load` now validates the skill name against `/^[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+$/` before constructing any file paths. Any name containing `..`, `/`, or shell-special characters is rejected immediately with an `{ error }` response.
- **Scope Path Traversal Block** — `scope_check` resolves the requested path and verifies it stays within the declared repo root before performing glob matching, preventing `../` escape attempts.
- **Shell Command Sanitization in Subagent** — `subagent_invoke` arguments are validated to reject empty or whitespace-only command strings before spawning child processes.

### Changed
- **Global 8KB Output Cap** — `makeHandler` in `src/index.ts` now unconditionally enforces a hard 8 192-byte ceiling on every MCP tool response via a recursive `truncateStrings()` helper. Previously, only a few tools manually applied truncation.
- **Sync AGENTS.md** — Restructured/corrected tool count to 29 across 10 modules, skill count to 30, and documented `subagent.ts` + `repo_summary.ts` in file layout and tools table.
- **Verify Smoke Test** — Added `skill_suggest` and `subagent_invoke` arguments payload to expected list, verifying 29 tools.
- **spec-driven-workflow Skill Downgrade** — Changed `tier` to 3 (on-demand only) and replaced duplicate keywords with `["riper", "riper-5", "deep-dive", "phase-detail", "chi tiết pha"]`.
- **Enabled Loop Guard expiration test** — Rewrote and enabled the previously skipped loop-guard reset test in `src/lib/loop-guard.test.ts` using Vitest's `vi.useFakeTimers()`.
- **AGENTS.md Template updates** — Updated `.harness/repo-summary.md` reference inside the default template, instructing newly initialized agents to read it immediately on session start.

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-30

### Changed
- **Migration from Bun to pnpm/node** — Shifted the project package manager to `pnpm` (and fallback `node`/`npm`) to avoid native addon issues on Windows.
  - Replaced Bun command runners in smoke test with Node.js.
  - Configured `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with `allowBuilds` for `better-sqlite3` and `esbuild` to automate native addon compilation under pnpm v11+.
  - Cleaned up obsolete `bun.lock` and `.npmrc` files.
  - Updated all documentation files (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, docs guides, planning docs) to reflect pnpm/node setup.
  - Updated `templates/init.sh.tpl` setup script to check for pnpm and fallback to npm.
  - Removed `bun` package manager detection and auto-detected commands from `src/lib/runtime.ts` and related unit tests.

### Verified
- `pnpm run build` — 0 TypeScript errors
- `pnpm test` — 151 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail (all unit tests passing under node/pnpm)
- `pnpm run smoke` — PASSED (MCP server boots and passes all 27 tool checks using Node.js)

  - **Tier 2 (Contextual):** 21 skills suggested when keywords match task context
  - **Tier 3 (On-demand):** 2 skills never auto-suggested (write-a-skill, verification-loop)
- **Metadata fields** in skill frontmatter:
  - `metadata.tier` — Skill priority (1, 2, or 3; default: 2)
  - `metadata.keywords` — Keywords for tier 2 matching (default: [])
- **Reduced skill noise** — `session_start` now returns only 3 tier 1 skills instead of 21

### Changed
- All 25 built-in skills updated with `tier` and `keywords` metadata
- `session_start` now filters applicable_skills to tier 1 only (3 skills)
- `skill_list` returns skills with metadata including tier and keywords

### Review fixes

**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### Fixed
- **Phase 6 acceptance gap:** `wrapTool` decorator now applied to ALL 25 MCP tool handlers (was defined but unused)
- **Phase 6 acceptance gap:** verify output parsers (`parseVitestJson`, `parseGenericOutput`) now integrated into `verify_run` — returns structured `test_results`
- **Phase 3.3 acceptance gap:** every tool call now emits `tool_success` audit event (verified: 3 tool calls → 3 JSONL entries)
- Removed unused imports across `src/cli/harness.ts`, `src/tools/verify.ts`, `src/tools/session.ts`
- Synced `package.json` version `0.1.0` → `0.6.0` to match server version
- Smoke test expanded to verify 19 tools (was 17), now also tests `scope_check` and `harness_status`
- Wrapper uses best-effort `try/catch` around audit calls — never breaks the tool

#### Architecture improvements
- `wrapTool` provides 3 layers per tool: try/catch, audit logging, loop detection
- All tool errors now return `{ error }` JSON instead of throwing — never crashes MCP transport
- Loop guard advisory warning appended to response payload
