# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

Create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/harness/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
6. **Spec self-review** — inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope
7. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review before proceeding
8. **Transition to implementation** — invoke plan-before-implement skill

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems, flag this immediately
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help decompose into sub-projects
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far

**Design for isolation and clarity:**
- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose
- Communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Each unit should be understandable and testable independently

**Working in existing codebases:**
- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Include targeted improvements as part of the design — don't propose unrelated refactoring.

## Spec Self-Review

After writing the spec document, check:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? Make it explicit.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** — Easier to answer when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** — Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** — Present design, get approval before moving on
