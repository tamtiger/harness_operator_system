# Dispatching Parallel Agents

## Overview

When you have multiple unrelated failures (different test files, different subsystems, different bugs), investigating them sequentially wastes time. Each investigation is independent and can happen in parallel.

**Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- 3+ test files failing with different root causes
- Multiple subsystems broken independently
- Each problem can be understood without context from others
- No shared state between investigations

**Don't use when:**
- Failures are related (fix one might fix others)
- Need to understand full system state
- Agents would interfere with each other

## The Pattern

### 1. Identify Independent Domains

Group failures by what's broken. Each domain is independent.

### 2. Create Focused Agent Tasks

Each agent gets:
- **Specific scope:** One test file or subsystem
- **Clear goal:** Make these tests pass
- **Constraints:** Don't change other code
- **Expected output:** Summary of what you found and fixed

### 3. Dispatch in Parallel

Issue all subagent dispatches in the same response — they run in parallel.

Multiple dispatch calls in one response = parallel execution.

### 4. Review and Integrate

When agents return:
- Read each summary
- Verify fixes don't conflict
- Run full test suite
- Integrate all changes

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Too broad:** "Fix all the tests" — agent gets lost
**✅ Specific:** "Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts" — focused scope

**❌ No context:** "Fix the race condition" — agent doesn't know where
**✅ Context:** Paste the error messages and test names

**❌ No constraints:** Agent might refactor everything
**✅ Constraints:** "Do NOT change production code"

## When NOT to Use

**Related failures:** Fixing one might fix others — investigate together first
**Need full context:** Understanding requires seeing entire system
**Exploratory debugging:** You don't know what's broken yet
**Shared state:** Agents would interfere (editing same files, using same resources)

## Verification

After agents return:
1. **Review each summary** — Understand what changed
2. **Check for conflicts** — Did agents edit same code?
3. **Run full suite** — Verify all fixes work together
4. **Spot check** — Agents can make systematic errors
